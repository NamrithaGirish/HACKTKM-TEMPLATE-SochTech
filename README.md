## How it Works ?
*Problem Statement*
The country is switching to home gardening. More terraces and balconies are getting green. Despite this changing trend there are multiple households holding themselves up due to the lack of knowledge regarding the same. More than 20% of the gardens fail to take root and produce ill output. This indicates the need to suggest effective ways of gardening specific to the space and climate. 

*Solution*
The number of students enrolling for agriculture and related field has seen an effective rise to almost 150 times in many universities. Taking this scenario also into sight we propose GreenConnect, a platform that aids such aspiring gardeners to *get customized support from Agricultural Science students. These graduate and post graduate students act as agricultural consultants who provide required guidelines through out the gardening stage. We also seek to **promote local sellers* of seeds, baskets and other green market products, share *beneficial Gov. and NGO based schemes* and provide incentives and certifications to the consultants.
Our platform offers exclusive chat features for the users to share the description of their scenario and narrate their requirements. Based on these proposals the students get assigned with their clients and propose their ideas to them. As an extension we also allow multiple users to *share their gardening and farming progress* with others as well. They shall also have the option to *sell and buy their gardening produce* as well. We also look forward in connecting with the existing ministries or other govt. supports and incorporate certificate validation for our consultants.

Like personal health care and fitness let good food and environment too be prioritized in this engaging world
